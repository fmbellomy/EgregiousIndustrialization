# Progression

## Early Game: (NoV, LV)

Much like GTNH, early game is spent mining large GT-style ore deposits and setting up rudimentary ore processing systems.
The steam and electric quarries have both been removed and replaced with Ore Drilling Plants [name pending. don't want to rip GT off *too* hard.]

The Electric Ore Drilling plant will consume bronze drills to mine ores from whatever GT ore vein it happens to be placed within the same chunk as. Once it has no ore blocks left to mine, it will be unable to produce more ores. Later on, the Bedrock Ore Drilling Plant will become available, which takes titanium drills to generate ores matching the vein the plant is placed on.

World traversal is made difficult by highly mountainous Tectonic world generation. Before stainless steel, the best options for movement are slime sling and hang glider.

### Needs

- prospecting and mining tools as starting quest reward
- mod for GT-style ore veins. (Mostly done, except for borked KubeJS integration)
- In-depth ore processing. (Not started)

## Mid Game (MV, HV)

- Eyes of Ender are uncraftable until the player has access to a chemical reactor running at 1024eu/t, at which point the player can go to the end and get an elytra. (Nerfed substantially by aileron.)
- Another map traversal option available once the player has reached stainless steel is Immersive Aircraft, which runs on MI liquid fuels.

## Late Game (EV, IV)

- Due to the incredible strength of the MI Fusion Reactor and Plasma Turbines, they will either be disabled or pushed back into EgV. (Egregious Voltage/Endgame Voltage)

### Power Generation

## Endgame (EgV, ???)
