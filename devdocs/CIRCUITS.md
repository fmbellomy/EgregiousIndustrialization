# EgInd Circuit Progression

## Motivation

Normal MI circuit progression demands exponentially increasing quantities of analog circuits and their components as you progress through the circuit tiers.
If EgInd is to include even a single additional circuit tier, let alone two, it will need to add ways to alleviate the increasing costs of circuit production.

## Implementation

Early game manual circuit crafting will be left the same.
The first divergence from base MI will be the addition of the Circuit Assembler, a machine dedicated to the many circuit recipes of the pack.

Normal MI progression provides one circuit recipe for each tier of circuit.

In EgInd, once you are (N+2 tiers) beyond a given circuit, you unlock a new recipe for it. I.E, once you have Silicon Wafers, you can etch them in a laser engraver to be sent into a circuit assembler as part of a recipe to make 4 analog circuits at a time.
