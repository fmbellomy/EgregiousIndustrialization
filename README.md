# Egregious Industrialization
Egregious Industrialization (EgInd) is a modpack centered around Modern Industrialization, with a reworked early game (No infinite ores in the steam age for you!), and custom GT style ore generation and ore processing lines.
## Development Progress:
The pack is in fairly early stages of development still, and many mods still need to have their recipes altered to require progression in MI.
